<h2>Attorney-Client Privileged — Confidential</h2>

<h3>VIA LAWPAL & EMAIL</h3>

<p>{{ client_full_name }} {{ object.name }}</p>

<p><b>Re:</b>      Letter of Engagement for {{ object.workspace.name }} (the “Company”)</p>


<p>Dear {{ client_full_name }}:</p>


<p>We are grateful that {{ object.workspace.name }} (“we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Firm”) will have the opportunity to provide legal services to you. We will strive at all times to provide you with the highest quality of professional representation, efficiently and cost-effectively, to earn your continued business.</p>


<h3>1.         Scope of Work</h3>

<p>We have agreed to preform the legal services described on Exhibit A – Part I. It is further understood that you may, but need not, ask us to perform other legal services now or in the future.  If we agree to perform such other services, then, unless a separate engagement letter has been entered into with respect to such other services, it is understood that such services will be performed according to the terms of this engagement letter.</p>

<p>To avoid any confusion, this engagement specifically will not include our representation of you in connection with those services described on Exhibit A – Part II.   Moreover, we will be providing only business legal services to you in connection with this engagement. You are not relying on us for, and we will not be providing, any investment, insurance, or accounting advice, or any investigation into the character or credit of persons with whom you may be dealing. You are strongly encouraged to consider, and to discuss with us, whether it is appropriate to retain non-attorney advisors with respect to any of those topics. We regularly coordinate with such advisors to address our clients’ needs and would be happy to do so for you.</p>


<h3>2.         Identity of Client</h3>

<p>The Firm represents the Company only and not any of its affiliates, owners, or agents, or any of the individuals associated with the Company.  By reason of this representation, the Firm does not represent you in your individual capacity or any of the Company’s parents, subsidiaries, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, or founders, or commonly owned corporations, partnerships or other entities.  Moreover, you acknowledge that we may be unable or unwilling to represent you individually (due to a conflict of interest or for other reasons) once we have begun our representation of the Company, and you consent to our representation of the Company despite this possibility.</p>


<h3>3.         Confidentiality</h3>

<p>Generally, it is in the Company’s best interests to preserve the confidentiality of all communications between this Firm and the Company.  If the Company discloses these communications, it jeopardizes the privileged nature of the communications, so we advise the Company not to disclose privileged information to third parties.</p>

<p>Our duty to protect the Company’s confidential information and the attorney-client privilege will belong to (and may be waived by) the Company alone.  Consequently, we may be obligated to disclose to the Company’s management (to the extent the Company’s management is someone other than you) information you have revealed to us that the Company may benefit from knowing, even if such disclosure is personally detrimental to you.</p>


<h3>4.         Professional Fees & Costs</h3>


<p>Work performed by attorneys, paralegals, and other professionals of the Firm will be billed at hourly rates currently ranging from ${{ rate_hourly_from }} to ${{ rate_hourly_to }} per hour, billed in increments of {{ rate_hourly_increments }} of an hour.  Our rates are subject to adjustment from time to time with prior notice, typically on an annual basis.  [List any discounts or arrangements made with the client, if any. For example, if you are providing a discount for timely payment of invoices, you might say “We are pleased to extend to you the following discount: the final invoice will be discounted by 10% for invoices paid in full within 21 days of transmittal)”.  If you have agreed to charge a flat fee for the work, you might say: “We have agreed to charge you a flat fee of ${{ rate_flat_fee }} for work on the above-mentioned financing, subject to such work not requiring protracted negotiations and also subject to your prompt cooperation and accurate provision of necessary information throughout the process.”]</p>

<p>Due to the changing nature of the law and the uniqueness of the facts of each matter, it is impossible for us to state with certainty how much time a given matter will take; we will nonetheless do our best to provide you with useful estimates before we begin and as work on your matter progresses. You can help us to keep your bills down by taking care to provide us with all facts relevant to your matter and by responding promptly and completely to requests for documents, information, and feedback throughout the course of our representation. Any estimates we may provide to you are only estimates and not guarantees. Please do not hesitate to discuss any concerns about legal fees you may have with me now or at any time in the future— we are committed to working with our clients to help them stay within their budgets whenever possible.</p>

<p>In addition, you will be responsible for reimbursement of any costs incurred in performing work on its behalf, such as filing and document order fees, online database searches, shipping and copying costs, and mileage and parking (if applicable). We reserve the right to include a reasonable mark-up to cover administration of such costs. Certain costs will be forwarded to you for direct payment, and you agree to make such payment timely. We may also require pre-payment of certain costs. Such pre-payment is not a retainer, but payment for costs incurred.</p>

<p>Invoices are usually sent out monthly, but occasionally we will group multiple smaller invoices into a single invoice or issue multiple invoices to one client in single month (such as when a client requests that different matters be billed separately). Payment for professional fees and cost reimbursement is due and payable upon invoicing.</p>


<h3>5.         Records Retention</h3>


<p>In order to keep costs down and reduce our environmental impact, we endeavor to maintain a “paperless” office to the greatest extent practical. To that end, we generally scan
client-related documents we create or that come into our possession (including without limitation notes and other attorney work product and executed final agreements). With the exception of certain documents that have intrinsic value as originals (such as stock certificates, certain government-stamped certificates, original promissory notes, and other negotiable instruments), we will usually securely shred original documents shortly after scanning, without giving you further notice.</p>

<p>We believe it is very unlikely that you or we will ever have need of originals destroyed in this manner. However, if you would prefer that we do not destroy any original documents, or if you would like us to preserve paper originals of specific documents, please so advise us immediately in writing and we will arrange to have them delivered to you (at your expense, if applicable) instead. By signing below, you consent to our destruction of originals in the
foregoing manner. In any event, we will be happy to provide you with electronic copies of any scanned documents in your file upon your request.</p>

<p>Please also be advised that in many situations, such as where agreements are executed using electronic signatures or in counterparts exchanged between the parties or their counsel via email, we may never come into possession of “ink” originals of the relevant documents; in such cases we will only be able to furnish you with electronic copies regardless of any instructions you may give us.]</p>


<h3>6.         Other Matters</h3>


<p>This engagement letter contains the entire agreement between the parties and shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. Our relationship with you will be deemed concluded when we have completed our agreed-upon services, except that for the avoidance of doubt, your obligations for fees and charges shall survive.  In addition, and without limiting the preceding sentence, in the event we have performed no work on your behalf for twelve consecutive months, you agree that our attorney-client relationship with you will have been terminated.
You may terminate the Firm’s representation at any time; however, you will be responsible for all costs incurred and professional fees for time spent as of the time of termination. We may likewise terminate and withdraw from our representation at any time as permitted by the California Rules of Professional Conduct. You agree not to object to any such withdrawal, including withdrawal as a result of your failure to pay fees or costs incurred.</p>

<p>While the subject matter of our representation and all our communications with you remain confidential, we wish to have the right, from time to time, to identify you and your business as a client of the firm, principally in online and print marketing materials. Please let me know if you do not wish to have us identify you as a client of the Firm in this or any manner.</p>

<p>If the above terms are acceptable to you, please sign and date below. We are committed to being a good partner and delivering real value to you as you build and grow your business. Please do not hesitate to let me know at any time if you have any questions or if there is anything we can do to serve you better.</p>

<p>Thank you for your trust and confidence in our Firm.</p>
