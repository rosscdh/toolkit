Core application
----------------

The core application is made up of a number of modules and services that define
our core architecture.

1. __attachments__ - provides document revisions and related services
2. __client__ - provides access to models for the VERY basic client app, clients are only added via matter.create, we have no interface to them other than that.
3. __item__ - matter.items and related service
4. __mixins__ - generic mixins that are used throughout the app
5. __services__ - various critical services that are used throughout (pusher, mixpanel etc.)
6. __signals__ - currently the activity listener signals are handled here

all_permissions = dict.fromkeys(p.PERMISSIONS, True)  # set them all to false

p.permissions = all_permissions
print p.permissions
```

### set to no permissions
