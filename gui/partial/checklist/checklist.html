								Hi Yael,
								<br />
								Note sure where to discuss this on the platform, so…
								<br /><br />
								We need to determine the size of the stock pool.
								<br /><br />
								[Edited below to recalculate numbers because eshares has a serious bug in cap table calculation—it (double) counts cancelled certificates.]
								<br /><br />
								As we discussed, you agreed with Ben to set it at 15% of the fully diluted capitalization, measured, presumably (it’s ambiguous), at the time of the stockholder agreement, which would have meant 141,177 shares (equal to 14.2% of the current fully diluted capitalization). I’m not sure why he wanted this provision in there, as it arguably acts as a floor to his own dilution, but it’s in there—so that’s your minimum.
								<br /><br />
								And your agreement with him also sets a cap of 20% (inclusive of non-pool grants) issuable to employees and consults without his approval, which would be 200,000 shares minus the 25,000 shares already issued to Richard and Ling = 175,000 shares (equal to 17.5% of the current fully diluted capitalization). So that’s your max.
								<br /><br />
								The other factor here is the capitalization reps in the note purchase agreement—originally you rep’d a fixed 20% pool. I’m not sure why this was necessary, as the conversion mechanism makes the company’s existing capitalization—at least with respect to common—irrelevant, but that was in there. In the first amended purchase agreement, you’ve replaced that rep with a “company expects” rep for up to 150,000 shares, which, given that the new language is basically meaningless, is definitely an improvement.
								<br /><br />
								So what shall we pick? 141,177 shares (roughly 14.2%), an even 150,000 shares (which will be roughly 15.4%), an even 175,000 shares (which will be exactly 17.5%), or something else between 141,177 and 175,000?
								<br /><br />
								Also, before I finalize this I want to be sure there’s been no further change to the capitalization reps in the second amended purchase agreement (adopted for the Kima Ventures investment), which I don’t have. Can you please send it my way ASAP?
								<br /><br />
								Finally, FYI, the rep in the amended version of 3(c)(ii) of the purchase agreement, regarding issued and outstanding shares as of the initial closing, while probably not material due to the conversion mechanism, is also incorrect—as of the *initial* closing, only 800,000 shares were outstanding, and this number shouldn’t be updated over time without clarifying the measurement date. If we get a chance to amend this again, we should strike that whole rep.
								<br /><br />
								Thanks,
								Adam
